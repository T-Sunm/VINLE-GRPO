# SMILE: A Composite Lexical-Semantic Metric for Question-Answering Evaluation

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2406.XXXX-blue.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.XXXX)

This repository provides an implementation of **SMILE: Semantic Metric Integrating Lexical Exactness**, a novel metric for evaluating natural language generation.
## What is SMILE?
SMILE is a lightweight and reliable evaluation metric for textual and visual question answering tasks. Unlike traditional metrics like ROUGE, METEOR, and Exact Match that focus purely on lexical overlap, or embedding-based metrics like BERTScore that overlook lexical precision, SMILE strikes a balance by combining sentence-level semantics, keyword-level understanding, and exact lexical matching. This hybrid approach offers a more comprehensive and interpretable evaluation, aligning closely with human judgment while avoiding the cost, bias, and inconsistency often associated with LLM-based metrics.

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SalesforceAIResearch/smile-metric-qna-eval.git
cd smile-metric-qna-eval
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can also install using pip:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/smile-metric-qna-eval.git
```

## Quick Run

Run the included sample script from the repository root to quickly verify your setup:

```bash
python3 smile_sample_usage.py
```

What this does:
- Loads the sample data from `sample_data/sample_input.json`
- Initializes SMILE with default settings (e.g., `ember-v1`, exact matching on)
- Computes scores and prints a concise summary

Example output (values will vary by environment/models):

```text

Step 1: Loading sample input 📥

Loaded rows: 3 📦

Sentence embedding score (mean): 0.8421 ✨
Keyword score (mean): 0.7667 🔑
SMILE avg (mean): 0.8044 😊
SMILE hm  (mean): 0.7923 🤝

-- First item details 🔎 --
question: What is the capital of France?
answer  : Paris
syn_ans : The capital of France is Paris.
pred    : Paris is known to the capital of France.
sent_emb_score: 0.8512 ✨
kwd_score     : 0.7500 🔑
avg           : 0.8006 😊
hm            : 0.7952 🤝
```

## Usage

You can use SMILE as a Python library or from the command line.

### Input Data Format
The input data for the evaluation script should in in JSON or JSONL format. Each entry in the file should be a dictionary containing the following keys:
- **id** or **question_id**: A unique identifier for the question.
- **question**: The question text.
- **answer**: The ground-truth answer(s) for the question. This can be a string list of strings (for multiple references).
- **syn_ans**: Synthetic answers generated for the question against each answer(s). Not required in case `use_ans` flag is set.
- **pred**: The predicted answer(s) for the question.
```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "question": "What is the capital of France?",
  "answer": "Paris",
  "syn_ans": "The capital of France is Paris.",
  "pred": "Paris is known to the capital of France." 
}
```

### Python API

```python
from smile.smile import SMILE
import sys

# Ensure we can import from pyscripts even when running from repo root
sys.path.append(str(Path(__file__).resolve().parent / "pyscripts"))
from generate_scores import load_data

# Example: evaluating a list of predictions against references - using the above input data format
input_path = "sample_data/sample_input.json"
args = SimpleNamespace(
        input_file=str(input_path),
        pred_file=None, # to be used if predictions are present in a separate file
        use_ans=False,
    )

proc_data = load_data(args)

# metrics to be computed - avg(average), hm(harmonic mean)
eval_metrics = ['avg', 'hm']
smile_obj = SMILE(emb_model = 'ember-v1',
                  eval_metrics = eval_metrics, 
                  assign_bins = <True/ False>, 
                  use_exact_matching = <True/ False>, 
                  save_emb_folder = <save emb folder path>, 
                  load_emb_folder = <load emb folder path>, 
                  syn_ans_model = <synthetic answer generation model name>, 
                  verbose = <True/ False>)
# When synthetic answer and ground-truth is a string
results = smile_obj.generate_scores(proc_data)
print(f"SMILE Score: {results}")
```

### Using generate_scores.py
The `generate_scores.py` script is a versatile tool for evaluating predictions against references using various metrics. It supports the following evaluation modes: SMILE, ROUGE, BERTScore, METEOR, Exact Match and sBERT.
#### Generating SMILE Scores
To compute SMILE scores, you can use the `--eval_mode`(default "smile"). The script automatically handles extracting the relevant keys from the input file and processes the data for evaluation.
```bash
python3 pyscripts/generate_scores.py \
      --input_file path/to/input.json(l) \
      --output_file path/to/output.pkl \
      --eval_mode smile \
      --timeit
```
> **Note**: You can set `--pred_file` in-case your predictions(i.e `pred`) are present in another file.
